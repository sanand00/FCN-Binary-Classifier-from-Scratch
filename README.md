A tool for training a Fully Connected Neural Network for binary classification, wrtitten completely from scratch using Python and NumPy. Example code is provided for a Cat-Dog image classification FCN, trained on [CIFAR-10](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html). 
*Note FCN's are generally not well-suited for image classifcation. See my [CNN-Image-Classifier](https://github.com/sanand00/CNN-Image-Classifier-and-CLI-tool) for a more suitable model for image classification.*

# Supported Architecture
- Any number of hidden layers
- ReLU activation function on all but last layer.
- Sigmoid actvation function on last layer.
- Cross-Entropy/Logistic Loss function
- L2 Regularisation

This project was mainly created with the intention of getting a deeper understanding of the inner workings of Neural Networks.
